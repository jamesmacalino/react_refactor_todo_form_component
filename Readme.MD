# React App ToDo List

##  Developing a ToDo List and having the ability to add and remove items from the list

###
App written in JS with React coding meant to exercise the forms process where you can add
and remove an element from the application.  I added styling through css to center the app
as well as experiment with color scheme.  To use, click on any element to remove the Todo item.  
add an item, type in a ToDo item in the block with the "What else?" label.  To reset the app, 
simply reload the web browser page.
